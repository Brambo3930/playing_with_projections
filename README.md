# Event stream
The event stream contains several types of events. The event stream is a JSON array of events. An event is structured like this:
```
{
  'id': 'a unique id for this event'
  'type': 'the type of the event',
  'timestamp': 'the moment the event happened',
  'payload': {
    'key1': 'value1',
    'key2': 'value2'
  }
}
```
